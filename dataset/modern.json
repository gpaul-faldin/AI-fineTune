While Attali does not fully develop this concept, it suggests a shift influenced by electronic music techniques such as sampling and remixing. This stage could signify a departure from traditional notions of fidelity and reproduction, potentially allowing for more experimental and innovative forms of music that draw from existing recorded materials, reflecting a more dynamic interaction with sound and composition."
